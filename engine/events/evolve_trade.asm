EvolveTradeMon:
; Verify the TradeMon's species name before
; attempting to initiate a trade evolution.

; The names of the trade evolutions in Blue (JP)
; are checked. In that version, TradeMons that
; can evolve are Graveler and Haunter.

; In localization, this check was translated
; before monster names were finalized.
; Then, Haunter's name was "Spectre".
; Since its name no longer starts with
; "SP", it is prevented from evolving.

; This may have been why Red/Green's trades
; were used instead, where none can evolve.

; This was fixed in Yellow.
