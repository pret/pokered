This is a purist's enhancement of Pokemon Red/Blue/Green. The goal is to enhance the original games for excellent replayability without bringing in mechanics, moves, sprites, visuals, type matchups, or pokemon that were introduced in later games. 
- It makes the bulk of the 151 original pokemon all more obtainable and usable in the early game, with better movesets and more balanced stats. 
- Many moves in the game were rebalanced or modified. When I say "rebalanced", I mean "the useless things were made more useful!" 
- There are more bug, poison, and ghost type moves available. The focus is on getting a useful set of moves available for every single pokemon in the game. 
- Front sprites were updated to be just about the best set of sprites from Red/Green/Blue/Spaceworld 1997 overall.
- All 151 pokemon are obtainable in all versions of this hack. 
- [Many small quality-of-life tweaks and bugfixes](https://github.com/Vortyne/pureRGB/blob/master/FEATURES.md#quality-of-life-enhancements) were made. 
- Game bugs that can be used to your own advantage (like the leech seed/toxic bug, the hyper beam no recharge on faint bug, etc.) are unchanged, because they are quirks of the battle engine that you can use as your own tool. 
- Mew is under the truck as expected!
- Missingno and the item duplication glitch are intact - but won't corrupt your save anymore!
- An entirely new mode for the pokedex called the MOVEDEX was added. It shows data about moves you have seen in detail. You unlock the MOVEDEX in viridian city.
- There are multiple secret areas to be found after becoming CHAMP. Bills Garden, Team Rocket / Mewtwo lore, and more...
- [Many options to enhance the game visually and mechanically were added.](https://github.com/Vortyne/pureRGB/blob/master/FEATURES.md#new-options-in-the-options-menu) **(You must turn them on via the options in-game!)** Including:
  - Switchable color palettes (Choose between original colors, Super Gameboy Colors, or Pokemon Yellow Colors in-game whenever you like! Works on GBC and Super Gameboy. Yes, this romhack has GBC support!)
  - Optional Spaceworld 1997 Back Sprites
  - Optional enhanced menu sprites/overworld icons
  - Optional stereo panned audio (Similar to the Earphone1 option in Pokemon Yellow)
  - Optional alternate color palette pokemon based on region (catch differently colored pokemon depending on where they appear in Kanto)
  - Option to turn off the bicycle song (plays in cycling road still)
  - Tweak the type matchups to be exactly like gen 1, gen 2, or a cross between them if you like directly in-game.
  - Optional in-battle experience bar
  - Option to give trainers some Stat EXP to their pokemon based on level. Makes the game a little bit harder.
- If you're playing on GBC and have the palettes set to SGB or GBC mode, move animations will have colors! Surf will be blue, ember will be red, etc.
- There are a couple entirely new things added into the game to facilitate quality of life fixes. Including:
  - An NPC who can permanently remove CUT trees.
  - An NPC who can revive fossils for you in SAFFRON CITY so you can get fossil pokemon a bit earlier.
  - An NPC who will give you LAPRAS a bit earlier in the game.
