; Originally, this referred to the Guard Spec as the item that protects from special moves.
; Obviously, this is wrong, and a mistranslation. In fact, this may be why it's called the Guard Spec at all.
; The Japanese name is "Effect Guard", which is far more transparent.
; Anyway, this has been changed to X Special, which is accurate.
; To take it a step further, I also note that it improves their own, which implies the Special stat's function to the player.
